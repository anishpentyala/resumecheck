# Changelog

## 0.2.1 (2026-10-30)

### Fixed

- **Batch-fingerprint one-sidedness now fails closed.** A batch
  fingerprint recorded in only one of the two trajectories previously
  skipped the batch comparison silently - the run could PASS on partial
  evidence with the strongest signal unchecked. It is now reported in
  `missing_fields` and fails the comparison, matching the documented
  fail-closed behavior for loss and grad_norm.
- **Batch fingerprints now encode structure, dtype, and shape.** The
  previous encoding hashed raw bytes joined by a separator, which could
  not distinguish a `b"\x01|\x02"` tensor from two `b"\x01"`/`b"\x02"`
  tensors, nor identical bytes under different dtypes or shapes.
  Fingerprints are now tagged and length-prefixed with dtype/shape
  headers, removing that collision class. Fingerprints change versus
  0.2.0; re-record baselines when upgrading (trajectories are
  run-scoped, so this only matters for saved trajectories compared
  across versions).

### Tests

- 5 new regression tests covering the one-sided-batch fail and the
  structure/dtype/shape fingerprint cases. 29 passed locally.
